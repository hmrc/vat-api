You can use the sandbox environment to <a href="/api-documentation/docs/testing">test this API</a>.

It may not be possible to test all scenarios in the sandbox. You can test some scenarios by passing the Gov-Test-Scenario header. Documentation for each endpoint includes a **Test data** section, which explains the scenarios that you can simulate using the Gov-Test-Scenario header.

If you have a specific testing need that is not supported in the sandbox, contact <a href="/developer/support">our support team</a>.
